\section*{\centering CONCLUSION}
During the bachelor's thesis, an analysis of mini robots was conducted, as well as an examination of the characteristics of mini manipulator robots and their shortcomings. The issues of using robots in collaboration with humans, the necessity for the features of creating collaborative robots were described. Variants of the engine, the choice, and options for controlling a brushless DC motor, as well as the option of using motor control, were considered, and the method of vector control with feedback was selected.

Functions and technical specifications for the developed control system for a collaborative mini manipulator robot were formulated. A hierarchical paradigm of robot control systems was considered and adopted as the basis for separating the principal control system schemes for the mini robot. The algorithm for interaction between tactical, strategic, and executive control systems was described. Algorithms were developed based on the described hierarchical levels of architecture:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The algorithm for the tactical control system operation;
	\item The algorithm for the executive control system operation.
\end{itemize}
A functional diagram of the device was developed in accordance with the selected components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gimbal GBM4008H-150T, GM5208-120T, GM3506;
	\item Absolute Encoder AS5600;
	\item Strategic control device Raspberry Pi Zero W 2;
	\item Power transistors SIR680DP;
	\item Drivers for power transistors L6385ED;
	\item Data bus transmitter TCAN1462DRQ1;
	\item DC-DC converter AP64502QSP.
\end{itemize}
Mathematical operations required for solving tasks were considered, and as a result, testing and analysis of available microcontrollers for vector control tasks and kinematic tasks were conducted. Two principal device schemes were developed, with the necessary calculations of elements for tactical, strategic, and executive control systems.
\begin{itemize}
	\item An algorithm for the control system of a mini manipulator robot was developed;
	\item An algorithm for the tactical control system of a mini robot;
	\item An algorithm for the executive control system of a mini robot.
\end{itemize}
Thus, it can be said that a control system for a collaborative mini manipulator robot has been successfully developed to demonstrate the capabilities of using Gimbal-type motors as the robot's actuating device. This topic remains relevant as components with similar characteristics but smaller in size continue to emerge.
