Nowadays the use of mini robot manipulators in modern production is rare and most of any small works are created manually or it is necessary to create machines for a specific task, which takes more time to develop on a more universal basis. And the use of human resources is a human factor and quality is reduced in pursuit of quantity.

The problem can be solved by creating a new robot manipulator that will be suitable for interaction with small objects, as well as more cost-effective in the process of exploitation.
